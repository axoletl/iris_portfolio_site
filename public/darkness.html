                    Darkness Full of Light</a>
                is a work of
                speculative fiction by Tony Dietz. In my opening
                sequence I aimed to depict protagonist Jozette's journey
                between dark and light; loneliness and unity, as she scales
                from the deep depths of the ocean to the surface and back.

                First pass of design boards prior to animation,
                on review I changed the colours of the light materials
                in order to get a more realistic emissive effect.
                Several shot transitions were also changed to flow better
                with the narrative of "up and down" at play in the story.

                As this was to be a primarily typographic sequence, I 
                wanted to create a custom typeface that suited the mood 
                and worldbuilding of the story. Jozette's people, the Mata, 
                are a futuristic society living on the ocean floor. Despite 
                their advancements, they live in scarcity of air, lighting 
                and space, and as such I took inspiration from durable low 
                power tech such as segmented LED watch displays, putting a 
                curved, humanist twist on it in reflection of their ironically 
                primative, insular state.
